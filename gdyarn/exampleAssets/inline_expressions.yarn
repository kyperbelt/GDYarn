// the place in a race for example - this will test ordinal format function
<<set $place = 2>>
// the next few variables will be used in pluralisation testing
// the number of apples I have
<<set $apples = ($place*3)^2>>

// expexted result - "I participated in a race and cam in 5th place."
I participated in a [color=#ff00ff]race[/color] and [wave]came in [/wave] {$place}[ordinal {$place} one="st" two="nd" few="rd" other="th"] place. #line:2693a5e6
// expected result - "The tree only has 2 apples!"
The tree only has [plural {$apples} one="one apple" other="% apples"]! #line:16a64e75
